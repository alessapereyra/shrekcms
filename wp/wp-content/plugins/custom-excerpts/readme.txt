== Description ==

Custom Excerpts allows you to implement custom excerpt text, length, and to choose HTML tags to allow and whether to make the link nofollow or dofollow. Previously the only way to achieve this was to edit the WordPress core file formatting.php which meant changes would be lost after each update.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the wplinkdir folder to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin via the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3. Options can be changed from Settings -> Custom Excerpts

That's it! Wherever the_excerpt is used in your theme files it will utilize the options you have set.
