Requires at least: 2.3
Tested up to: 2.7

A Plugin to give the administrators some simple page hit stats that aren't at all confusing.

== Description ==

It gives you the following information:

    * The number of visitors in the last day (configurable) (v1.0)
    * The number of pages each visitor looked at (v1.0)
    * Which pages have been looked at (v1.0)
    * The times each page was visited (v1.0)
    * The visitor count displayed per page (v1.1)
    * Recent site activity (2.0)
    * Wordpress 2.7 support and restructure (v2.0)
    * Support for user excludes by session_id, user_id or ip address (v2.0)
    * Support for page excludes (v2.0)
    * Delete data functionality (v2.0)

That’s it, no more, no less!

I find that a lot of stats plugins give a little too much information and in doing so making both the stats harder to read and analyse. Session Manager differs because what it provides is a very light weight logging implementation with a simple yet effective front end allowing you to view the data in a number of ways.

I have been using it on this site and newmedias.co.uk since mid 2008 and it has been instrumental in giving me enough data to satisfy that ‘whose looking at my site’ itch while not distracting me too much from what I was doing in the first place (as other stats plugins like Woopra can do).

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the files from the zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/session_manager/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. After a few minutes you will see the hits coming in through the interface under 'Session Manager' in the top bar (<2.7) or the side bar (2.7+)
